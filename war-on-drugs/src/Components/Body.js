      The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) is the leading organization in the U.S. promoting alternatives to the war on drugs. We envision a just society in which the use and regulation of drugs are grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights; in which people are no longer punished for what they put into their own bodies; and in which the fears, prejudices, and punitive prohibitions of today are no more.Since 2000, we led the way on creating cutting-edge policies that have fundamentally transformed the direction of drug policy in the U.S. and beyond. This includes a successful and growing marijuana reform movement across the nation. We are leading the movement to treat drug use as a health issue, not a criminal problem. In 2020, we made history in Oregon by decriminalizing drugs for the first time ever in the United States, and dramatically expanding health services in the state.DPA has grown to more than 40 staff across the U.S.; an annual operating budget of approximately $12 million, 12,000 dues-paying members and more than 170,000 online subscribers.
