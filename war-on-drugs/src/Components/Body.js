          The war on drugs brought about policies that are being misused for the incarceration and imprisonment of the black community. According to the Drug Policy Alliance nearly 80% of people in federal prison and almost 60% of people in the state prison for drug offenses are black or latino. The drug policies were not created to help the low income communities, they were created to tear their families a part. As a result of the discrimination against blacks and the misuse of the war on drugs, came about policies that would end drug offenders simple humans rights. A few consequences faced by drug offenders are policies that denied child custody, voting rights, employment, business loans, etc. These policies were clearly created with the intent to keep black people from progressing. Individuals who were not native Americans or born here would face harsh consequences when caught using drugs, deportation and detention being a part of the list. As a nation we must  hope to be successful at such task as we advocate for the legal system to decriminalize drug possession, make changes to the policies that will remove the harsh sentencing, provide diversity programs and so on.
