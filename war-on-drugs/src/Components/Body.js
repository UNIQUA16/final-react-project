        The war on drugs brought about policies that are being misused for the
        incarceration and imprisonment of the black community. According to the
        Drug Policy Alliance nearly 80% of people in federal prison and almost
        60% of people in the state prison for drug offenses are black or latino.
        The drug policies were not created to help the low income communities,
        they were created to tear their families a part. As a result of the
        discrimination against blacks and the misuse of the war on drugs, came
        about policies that would end drug offenders simple humans rights. A few
        consequences faced by drug offenders are policies that denied child
        custody, voting rights, employment, business loans, etc. These policies
        were clearly created with the intent to keep black people from
        progressing. Individuals who were not native Americans or born here
        would face harsh consequences when caught using drugs, deportation and
        detention being a part of the list. As a nation we must hope to be
        successful at such task as we advocate for the legal system to
        decriminalize drug possession, make changes to the policies that will
        remove the harsh sentencing, provide diversity programs and so on.

          THE DRUG WAR DRIVES RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM

        <h3>UNJUST CONSEQUENCES FROM THE WAR ON DRUGS CAMPAIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <b>
            Blacks comprised 43% and Whites 55% of persons convicted of drug
            felonies in state courts; Black people account for 53.5% and Whites
            for 33.3% of persons admitted to state prisons for new convictions
            for drug offenses.{" "}

            The legal system in America then and now made it their jobs to
            heavily criminalize blacks who were caught doing drugs, giving them
            the harshest possible punishments. Severals bills were passed to
            ensure mass incarceration of black drug users. One most evident
            being the Comprehensive Crime Control and Safe Act in 1984. It is
            evident that this bill was not created to gain control of the drug
            use in America as it eliminates parole in the federal system which
            resulted in the upsurge of prisoners, black prisoners to be
            specific. Another horrific bill called the Violent Crime Control and
            Safe Streets Act of 1994 was passed. The nightmares of the minority
            communities seemed to have no end as the legal system continues to
            misuse the drugs policies to terrorize them. Federal law enforcement
            and unfair prosecutorial practices resulted in the black people
            disproportionately arrested, convicted and imprisoned for the use
            and distribution of illicit drugs. After years of marching and
            fighting for justice the minorities were able to get a taste of
            justice at the tips of their tongues. The Second Chance Reentry bill
            and the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act were passed. Though not enough
            these bills immediately helped to reduce the conviction and imprison
            of the minorities for the use of illegal drugs. Other bills were
            passed such as the Sentencing Reform and Correction Act of 2015 and
            First Step Act of 2018. Many black prisoners were release from
            prisons while others got reduced sentencing.We must not be satisfied
            with the norm, but work toward institutionalizing the demand for
            standard of decency that values transformative change.{" "}
